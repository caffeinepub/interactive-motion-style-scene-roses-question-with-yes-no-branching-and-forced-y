# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Yes-branch follow-up message to remove the word “white” while keeping all existing behavior and visuals unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the Yes-branch follow-up text (including the forced-Yes flow) to exactly: "You are right — here's tulips for you."
- Ensure no Yes-branch follow-up message includes the word "white" in the phrase "here's ... tulips for you".

**User-visible outcome:** After clicking “Yes” (including via the forced-Yes flow), the follow-up message reads exactly: "You are right — here's tulips for you."
