# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the website/page name (browser tab title) easy to change and document exactly where to update it.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the `<title>...</title>` in `frontend/index.html` to a clearly editable app name string (replacing the current "Valentine's Interactive Website").
- Add/update a short developer-facing documentation note that specifies the exact file path(s) and element/line to edit to change the website name (including `frontend/index.html`), and note any other title-setting location if applicable.

**User-visible outcome:** After rebuilding, the browser tab shows the updated website name, and developers can quickly find where to change it in the repository.
