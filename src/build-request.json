      "id": "REQ-9",
      "text": "Add a small playful “twist” micro-interaction to the existing roses-boring Yes/No flow on `frontend/src/pages/ValentinePage.tsx` that makes the interaction feel more fun without changing the required primary text strings or the Yes/No branching outcomes.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "The existing interaction flow remains the same: initial Yes/No choices; clicking No shows the existing No-branch message and a single Yes button; clicking Yes opens the existing success modal.",
        "The twist is a purely visual/motion micro-interaction (e.g., a brief button dodge/wiggle/bounce, sparkle burst, or similar) that does not block the user from clicking either option (mouse and keyboard).",
        "No new user-facing text is introduced as part of the twist (so the app continues to comply with the exact-string requirements for the three key texts).",
        "The twist does not introduce TypeScript lint/type errors and `npm run build` succeeds."

  "constraints": [
    "Frontend files under `frontend/src/components/ui` and the paths listed in `frontend.immutablePaths` must not be edited; compose existing components instead.",
    "Do not add new backend canisters/services; backend remains single-actor and unchanged for this twist unless strictly necessary.",
    "Do not change the required exact user-facing strings already specified for the main question, the Yes-branch message, or the No-branch message."

  "nonGoals": [
    "Adding new authentication methods beyond Internet Identity.",
    "Adding real-time features (WebSockets/chat) or external databases/services.",
    "Changing the existing roses-boring story logic or adding new branching paths beyond the existing Yes/No flow."
